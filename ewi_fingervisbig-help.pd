#X text 184 86 This object takes no inlets or outlets. It has the notein
it needs builtin. If you are playing a note on an EWI \, it will show
the fingering (or a fingering) for the note displayed. If Midi CC is
0 \, or if you are playing a C# \, it will show blank.;
#X text 184 213 The fingering shown is based on the midi note value.
This patch has no way to actually know what fingering you are using
to produce that note. It just shows *a* fingering you could be using
to produce that note.;
