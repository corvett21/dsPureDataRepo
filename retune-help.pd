#X text 167 31 Retune takes a midi note number (i or f) and "retunes"
it to a different tuning system. There's a wonderful wikipedia article
about the Carlos Alpha and Carlos Beta scales developed by Wendy Carlos
for her album Beauty in the Beast \, and I've found they're great fun
to improv over. I personally hate the Bohlen-Pierce temperment \, which
stretches the octave to a ratio of 3:1 instead of 2:1. 19 EDO is sort
of the opposite: it compressed an octave and a fifth down to one octave
\, where there's 3 3rd tones per whole step.;
#X text 160 305 The values coming out of the outlet are floats. They
can be run through [mtof] to get to the target frequencies for your
new tuning system.;
#X text 168 200 The second inlet takes an interger 0 to 4 to select
a tuning scale.;
#X text 166 239 The Third inlet sets the "pivot" note around which
the notes are rescaled. It will stay fixed to our A440 tuning system.
